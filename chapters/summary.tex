\section{Summary}

This thesis enhances robotic positioning systems by integrating inertial navigation systems, inspired by aviation principles, with knowledge of mechanical design. The work done is part of a project being carried out at Division of Theory of Machines and Robots. The primary goal is to fill a crucial gap in the existing setup â€“ the absence of position and orientation sensors.\\

The thesis explores fundamental navigation sensors, recognizing their limitations. It discusses strategies like filtering and sensor fusion to mitigate errors and obtain accurate position and orientation estimates. The proposed solution involves designing the experimental platform. This system modify inertial navigation to estimate coordinates efficiently as the platform moves, addressing specific motion constraints.\\

Anticipated outcomes include a deep understanding of position and orientation measurement systems and the design of a prototype tailored for robotic applications. This thesis may improve positioning systems, benefiting both the division's projects and the broader field of robotics.
