\chapter{Content}

Limited, incomplete system description. Logger/recorder as part of many projects\\

Sensors: model, calibration, tips, review, types, time synchronization\\

Sensor fusion: different AHRS, Why EKF is best of all.\\

Constraints, its derivative, why I dont use velocity constraints. Equations\\

Constraint correction method: similar to NR, add scaler, add repeats, maybe some sophisticated methods.\\

System architecture, tests, gui, mocks, logs, prototype\\
Specs, technologies, c++/python/docker/esp, multi-threading\\

Case study: multibody, overconstrained, linear dependent constraints. Position source with lower sample rate. No orientation source. Force logger plugin\\

Tuning\\

Experiments: circular motion with different velocity in two direction. Comparation between:
Position only, IMU only, IMU + constrainted, Position + constraints, Full working solution.\\
